# Screening Exercise

This Repository is a demonstration of automatic speech recognition (ASR) using the Transformer model with TensorFlow. 

To train and evaluate the Transformer model, I used the LJSpeech dataset from the LibriVox project. This dataset consists of short audio clips of a single speaker reading passages from 7 non-fiction books. Each audio clip is paired with a corresponding text transcript, which will as the ground truth labels for our training data.

To run this project, you will need to have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3
TensorFlow

Once you have installed the necessary dependencies, you can run the Jupyter Notebook ASR_with_Transformer.ipynb to train and evaluate the Transformer model. The notebook includes step-by-step instructions for loading the LJSpeech dataset, preprocessing the data, and training the model.

During training, the model will be trained to predict the correct text transcript given an input audio segment.
